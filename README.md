#Purpose.
This project is only for educational/remainder/draft/poc/test projects.
The code may not be clean, the structure or naming can be improve, etc.
Do not evaluate, place judgemnte or mimic coding style, efficiency of the solution, etc. based on that.
## The main idea of this project is to document and persist small pieces that can later be recalled and emulate based on the context.
This project is a notebook repository if you will, and can contain full ideas, or just pieces of code.
